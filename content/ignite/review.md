# Lab review

Over the course of the lab you explored the core functionality of GitHub Copilot. You saw how to use code completion to get inline suggestions, chat participants to explore your project, Copilot instructions to add context, and Copilot Agent to make updates autonomously. You also worked with SQL Server using the GitHub Copilot for MSSQL extension to query databases using natural language, and explored how Copilot can interact with Azure resources and help you create infrastructure as code. 

But there is a lot more in GitHub Copilot (just to name a few):

- [Copilot Edits][copilot-edits] - Multi-file editing with a working set
- [Slash commands][slash-commands] - Shortcuts for common tasks
- [MCP Servers support][MCP-server]
- [Extend Copilot][Extensibility-VS-Code]
- [Test with AI][test-with-ai]
- [Debug with AI][debug-with-ai]
- Copilot features available in GitHub
  - [Copilot coding agent][gh-coding-agent]
  - [GitHub Copilot code review][code-review]
  - [Extensions][copilot-extensions]
  - [Answers about issues, PRs, discussions, files, commits, etc][asking-github-copilot-questions]
- [Awesome Copilot][awesome-copilot] - Curated list of resources and best practices. Has example of [instructions](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/tree/main/instructions), [prompts](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/tree/main/prompts), and more
- [GitHub Copilot Chat Cookbook][copilot-cookbook] Examples of prompts to use with GitHub Copilot Chat.

There is no one right way to use GitHub Copilot. Continue to explore and try different prompts to discover what works best for your workflow and how GitHub Copilot can aid your productivity.
